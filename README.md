# Kaggle---Titanic-Dataset

I have used the Titanic dataset for this exercise and the codes from discussion board to learn and practice fundamentals of data wrangling and modeling in Python. The objective of this exercise was to help me get back to coding in Python.
The code uses two files train and test dataset to predict the survivors from the infamous Titanic debacle.
